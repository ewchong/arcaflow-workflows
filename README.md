# Arcaflow Example Workflows

Workflows created and maintained by the Arcaflow team. The `basic-examples` show how to use particular features of workflows. The `advanced-examples` provide more real-world use cases.

## Contributing

You can use a cluster local to your machine to functionally test your workflows. See the [local development documentation](docs/local-development.md).
